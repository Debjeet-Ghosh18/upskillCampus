🌾 Crop Yield Prediction Dashboard

A Machine Learning-powered interactive dashboard for predicting agricultural crop yields and production in India.
Developed during my Industrial Internship with Upskill Campus & The IoT Academy in collaboration with UniConverge Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

🚀 Project Highlights

✅ Predicts crop yield & production from historical agricultural datasets
✅ Built using Python, Scikit-learn, Dash, and Plotly
✅ Supports interactive charts, filters, and trend analysis
✅ Best performing model: Random Forest (R² ≈ 0.83)

⚙️ Tech Stack

Programming & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash

Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Data Handling: CSV datasets (2001–2014) covering yield, production, and area

📊 Features

📈 Production Analysis: Trends, seasonal distribution, and state-wise comparison

🎯 Productivity Insights: Efficiency, performance matrix, and resource utilization

🗺️ Crop Distribution: Area, yield comparison, and seasonal production patterns

🤖 ML Predictions: Crop yield & production forecasting with trained models
